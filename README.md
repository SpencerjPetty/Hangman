# Hangman

Time spent on the challenge: 3 hours 50 minutes

This is a simple Hangman game, written using HTML and JavaScript. The player is asked to guess a secret word which is chosen from a bank of 10 possible words and tries to guess it in as few tries as possible.

I was able to complete the basic requirements, but unfortunately I was not able to draw the gallows and the hangman with the remaining time I had. If I had more time I would have made the actual hangman illustration and would have styled the page to make it look nicer and more entertaining. I also would have liked to use more Object Oriented Programming, but I'm not yet experienced enough with objects to understand fully their potential and possible uses. That's something I'm looking forward to learning!

I hope you enjoy this program!
