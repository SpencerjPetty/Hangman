Hangman Coding Challenge


## Recent changes 11/15/2024
I did this challenge this same time last year, so I talked to Joe and he said I could work on improving the hangman program rather than doing it again from scratch.
The one thing I still haven't learned is Object Oriented Programming, so I'm looking forward to learn that as I continue in the IS Program.

### Improvements made since last time (~2.5 hours of extra work)
1. Created an option to receive a random word from an API,
rather than from the word bank 
2. Made it so the random word is a certain number of letters which the user chooses
3. Modified the Play Again functionality to be in a button rather than an alert
4. Added the Hangman illustration and a limited number of guesses, so the player can lose
5. Improved some QoL changes (Enter key now working for input, focus goes to the input box automatically, box is cleared after invalid inputs)
6. Added a Quit button that redirects to Google rather than a confirm box which did the same thing
7. Added more visual features such as coloring and the background image
8. Full word shows after losing

Time spent on the challenge: 3 hours 50 minutes

This is a simple Hangman game, written using HTML and JavaScript. The player is asked to guess a secret word which is chosen from a bank of 10 possible words and tries to guess it in as few tries as possible.

I was able to complete the basic requirements, but unfortunately I was not able to draw the gallows and the hangman with the remaining time I had. If I had more time I would have made the actual hangman illustration and would have styled the page to make it look nicer and more entertaining. I also would have liked to use more Object Oriented Programming, but I'm not yet experienced enough with objects to understand fully their potential and possible uses. That's something I'm looking forward to learning!

I hope you enjoy this program!
